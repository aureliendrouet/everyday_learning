Procedural Generation
===

In computing, procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually.

In video games, it is used to automatically create large amounts of content in a game. Advantages of procedural generation include smaller file sizes, larger amounts of content, and randomness for less predictable gameplay.

Teleological Algorithms
---
The teleological approach creates an accurate physical model of the environment and the process that creates the thing generated, and then simply runs the simulation, and the results should emerge as they do in nature.

For examples:
- Artificial Life
- Dynamic Weather
- Fire Propagation
- Fluid Dynamics
- Genetic Algorithm
- Rain Drop Algorithm
- Reaction-Diffusion System

Ontongenetic Algorithms
 ---
The ontogenetic approach observes the end results of this process and then attempts to directly reproduce those results by ad-hoc algorithms. Ontogenetic approaches are more commonly used in real-time applications such as games.

Examples:
- City Generation
- Diamond-Square Algorithm
- Dungeon Generation
- Height Maps
- L-System
- Mazes
- MegaTexture
- Midpoint Displacement Algorithm
- Perlin Noise
- Simplex Noise
- Voronoi Diagram
