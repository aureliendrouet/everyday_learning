# Hamming Weight

The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used.

In the binary case, it is the number of 1 in the binary number. It is also called the population count, popcount, sideways sum, or bit summation.

## O(log n)

```c
int bitcount(unsigned int n)
{
    unsigned int count = 0;

    while (n > 0) {
        count = count + 1;
        n = n & (n - 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

## O(1)

```c
int bitcount(unsigned int u)
{
     unsigned int count;

     count = u - ((u >> 1) & 033333333333) - ((u >> 2) & 011111111111);
     return ((count + (count >> 3)) & 030707070707) % 63;
}
```
