# Fast Inverse Square Root

Fast inverse square root is an algorithm that estimates 1/âˆšx, the reciprocal of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number x (in IEEE 754 floating-point format).

Computer graphics programs use inverse square roots to compute angles of incidence and reflection for lighting and shading.

The algorithm is best known for its implementation in 1999 in the source code of Quake III Arena.

```c
float Q_rsqrt( float number )
{
  long i;
  float x2, y;
  const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

  x2 = number * 0.5F;
  y  = number;
  i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
  i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck?
  y  = * ( float * ) &i;
  y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
//  y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) ); // 2nd iteration, this can be removed

  return y;
}
```
