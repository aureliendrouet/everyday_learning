Penner Easing Equations
===

Easing functions specify the rate of change of a parameter over time.

Objects in real life donâ€™t just start and stop instantly, and almost never move at a constant speed. When we open a drawer, we first move it quickly, and slow it down as it comes out. Drop something on the floor, and it will first accelerate downwards, and then bounce back up after hitting the floor.

Examples
---

```c
/// <summary>
/// Easing equation function for a simple linear tweening, with no easing.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="t">Current time in seconds.</param>
/// <param name="b">Starting value.</param>
/// <param name="c">Final value.</param>
/// <param name="d">Duration of animation.</param>
/// <returns>The correct value.</returns>
public static float Linear(float t, float b, float c, float d)
{
    return c * t / d + b;
}
```

```c
/// <summary>
/// Easing equation function for a quadratic (t^2) easing in:
/// accelerating from zero velocity.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="t">Current time in seconds.</param>
/// <param name="b">Starting value.</param>
/// <param name="c">Final value.</param>
/// <param name="d">Duration of animation.</param>
/// <returns>The correct value.</returns>
public static float QuadEaseIn(float t, float b, float c, float d)
{
    return c * (t /= d) * t + b;
}
```
