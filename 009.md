HSV Color Space
===

Hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color space is often used by artists.

__Hue__ is what we normally think of as color. It is the attribute of a color by which we give it a name such as "red" or "blue".

__Value__ is another word for lightness, the attribute of a color that makes it seem equivalent to some shade of gray between black and white.

__Saturation__ is a measure of how different a color appears from a gray of the same lightness. Zero saturation indicates no hue, just gray scale.

    vec4 k = vec4(1.0, 2.0 / 3.0, 1.0 / 3.0, 3.0);
    vec3 p = abs(fract(c.xxx + k.xyz) * 6.0 - k.www);
    return c.z * mix(k.xxx, clamp(p - k.xxx, 0.0, 1.0), c.y);
}

void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
    vec3 hsv = vec3(mod(iTime * 0.1, 360.0), 1.0, 1.0);
    vec3 rgb = hsv2rgb(hsv);
    fragColor = vec4(rgb, 1.0);
}
