# HSV Color Model

Hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color model is often used by artists.

__Hue__ is what we normally think of as color. It is the attribute of a color by which we give it a name such as "red" or "blue".

__Value__ is another word for lightness, the attribute of a color that makes it seem equivalent to some shade of gray between black and white.

__Saturation__ is a measure of how different a color appears from a gray of the same lightness. Zero saturation indicates no hue, just gray scale.

vec3 hsv2rgb( in vec3 c )
{
    vec3 rgb = clamp(abs(mod(c.x * 6.0 + vec3(0.0, 4.0, 2.0), 6.0) - 3.0) - 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    return c.z * mix(vec3(1.0), rgb, c.y);
}

void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
    vec3 hsv = vec3(mod(iTime * 0.1, 360.0), 1.0, 1.0);
    vec3 rgb = hsv2rgb(hsv);
    fragColor = vec4(rgb, 1.0);
}
```

## Color Model vs Color Space

A color model is a method of describing a color. For example with Red, Green and Blue (RGB) elements or with Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK).

A color space is the set of colors which can be displayed or reproduced in a medium (whether stored, printed or displayed). For example, sRGB is a particular set of intensities for red, green and blue and defines the colors that can be reproduced by mixing those ranges of red, green and blue.
