# Cryptography - Symmetric Key

A cryptographic technique where both parties in the communication share the same key.

There are two types of symmetric cryptography:
- Stream Cipher
- Block Cipher

## Stream Cipher

Type of symmetric key cryptographic

Use a fixed length key to produce a pseudo-random stream of bits (same key gets you the same stream)

XOR those bits with your PT in order to encrypt

XOR those same bits with your CT in order to decrypt

Tries to approximate a one-time-pad

### Real-World Stream Cipher

#### RC4
- Used in WEP for wireless network security
- One option in TLS/HTTPS for encrypting web traffic
- Not recommended for use anymore

#### A5/1
- use for encrypting GSM phone data and conversations
- NSA is known to be routinely breaking it

## Block Cipher

Type of symmetric key crypto

Use a fixed length key to encrypted a fixed length block of data

Similar to a substitution cipher (but a much larger alphabet)

Example: if we have a 64-bit block cipher, then our substitution table has 2^64 entries

### Real-World Block Ciphers

#### Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- 64-bit block size
- 56-bit key size
- release in 1976
- US government standard until 2001

#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- 128-bit block size
- 128, 192 or 256 bit key size
- current US government standard
- most widely used
- considered very secure

### Properties of Block Ciphers

Plaintext to T mappings must be 1-to-1 for a given key
- this means the same PT always become the same CT (and vice-versa)

Input and output should have no correlation
- change 1-bit of the input block and the change on the output should not be distinguishable from random

### Features of Block Ciphers

__Block size__: bigger is more secure, but probably slower

__Key size__: bigger is more secure, but probably slower
