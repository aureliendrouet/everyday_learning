# Cryptography - Diffie-Hellman

## Symmetric Key Crypto Problem

Symmetric key crypto lets two parties share secret messages as long as they already have a shared key.

How do you share secret messages with someone when you don't already have a shared key?

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 (independently invented at GCHQ a few years earlier, but never released).

Allows to exchange a key in a secure way.

The mathematics is based on modulo exponentiation.

Its makes use of prime numbers and primitive roots.

## Math Example

Alice and Bob agree on a prime number __p__ and a base value __g__. Here, p=23 and g=5

Alice chooses a secret number __a__ and sends Bob __A__ with A = g^a mod p. Here, a=6
- A = 5^6 mod 23
- A = 15625 mod 23
- A = 8

Bob chooses a secret number __b__ and sends Alice __B__ with B = g^b mod p. Here, b=15
- B = 5^15 mod 23
- B = 30 517 578 125 mod 23
- B = 19

Alice computes __s__ with s = B^a mod p
- s = 19^6 mod 23
- s = 47 045 881 mod 23
- s = 2

Bob computes __s__ with s = A^b mod p
- s = 8^15 mod 23
- 2 = 35 184 372 088 832 mod 23
- s = 2

Alice and Bob now share a secret, s=2, that can't be derived from the public information.

## In Practice

a, b and p would need to be much large in practice, 100s of digits long

This works because the eavesdropper can't use A and B to figure out the secret numbers a and b chosen by Alice and Bob (this is called the discrete logarithm problem).

The algorithm does't prove who you share the key with, just that the key isn't known by anyone else.
