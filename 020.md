# Cryptography - Hashing

## Definition

Take an arbitrary message, compute a fixed length hash.

Sometimes it is called a message digest.

Used outside of security as well.
- Not all hash functions can be used for security.
- We are concerned with cryptographic hash functions!

## Properties of a Secure Hash function

### Pre-image resistance (or One Way)

Infeasible to determine M from H(M)

### Second pre-image resistance

Given M1, infeasible to find M2 such that H(M1) = H(M2)

### Collision resistance

Can't find any M1, M2 such that H(M1) = H(M2)

## Examples of Real Hash Functions

### MD5

- produces a 128-bit hash
- collisions can be found in ~2^21 hashes

### SHA1

- 160-bit hash
- collisions can be found in 2^61 hashes

### SHA2

- actually 4 different hash functions: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512
- minor attacks, but still good

### SHA3

- just chosen as a new NIST (national institute standards and technologies) standard
- no known attacks

## Application of Hash Functions

- Detect errors in file transfers
- Message Authentication Code (MAC)
- Password storage

## Application: MAC

Hashing with a key. The goal is to create a hash that can only be created or verified by someone with the key.

### Simple technique
- H(K | H(K | M))

__H__: hash function  
__K__: key  
__M__: message  

## Application: Password storage

When designing an application that stores passwords, don't store them in plaintext
- if someone steals your password file, then they have all the user passwords!
- store hashes instead

Note: if you really are going to do this, don't jus store hashes. Read about something called PBKDF (Password-Based Key Derivation Function)
