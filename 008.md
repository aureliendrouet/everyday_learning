# Grayscale Algorithm

A grayscale image is an image in which the value of each pixel is a single sample, that is, it carries only intensity information. Images of this sort, also known as black-and-white, are composed exclusively of shades of gray, varying from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest.

All grayscale algorithms utilize the same basic three-step process:

1. Get the red, green, and blue values of a pixel.
2. Use fancy math to turn those numbers into a single gray value.
3. Replace the original red, green, and blue values with the new gray value.

## Colorimetric (luminance-preserving) Conversion To Grayscale

```c
// Running on shadertoy at
// https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tlyDN
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
    vec2 uv = (fragCoord.xy / iResolution.xy);
    vec3 gammaColor = texture(iChannel0, uv).xyz;
    // ungamma (should be 2.2 but...)
    vec3 color = pow(gammaColor, vec3(2.0));
    // grayscale conversion
    float gray = dot(color, vec3(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722));
    // regamma
    float gammaGray = sqrt(gray);
    fragColor = vec4(gammaGray, gammaGray, gammaGray, 1.0);
}
```
