# Cryptography - Legacy

## Terminology

__Cryptography__: Method to send secret messages using a code  
__Cryptanalysis__: Trying to break the code and read those messages  
__Plaintext__: A message in its original form
__Ciphertext__: A message in coded form
__Encryption__: Transforming PT to CT

## Shift Cipher

### Cryptography

Generic version of Caesar cipher.

Each letter is shifted by N (in Caesar, N=3).

### Cryptanalysis

How do we break this?

Brute-force: try all possible values for N

There are only 26

Feasiblity?
- easy by hand
- trivial by computer

## Substitution Cipher

### Cryptography

Generate a random set of substitutions for each letter.

### Cryptanalysis

Brute-force: try all possible letter combinations

There are 26!

Not going to do that by hand...

Key observation: in a Substitution cipher, basic language features are preserved
- you can tell how often a letter occurs in the message
- you can see when letters repeat
- etc.

### Frequency Analysis

A cryptanalysis technique described in the 9th century by Al-Kindi in Iraq.

Not all letters in a language occur with the same frequency

Languages have certain features

In English
- e is most common
- vowels are about 40%
- vowels tend to be separated by consonants
- q tends to be followed by u
- etc.

## Vigenere Cipher

Poly-alphabetic Cipher
- one plaintext letter can become different ciphertext letters

Uses a text based key and modulo arithmetic to perform the encryption

Frequency analysis is possible but much more difficult

## One-Time Pad

Vigenere cipher with a randomly chosen key as long as the message

Key needs to be shared between parties beforehand

Key can never be re-used

Provable unbreakable without the key

This is the only perfect Cryptography

## Quic Note: Crypto Components

All of previous techniques have two basic components:
- __Algorithm__ what you do to the message
- __Key__ the secret that you need in order to encrypt/decrypt properly

When using these algorithms, the key is secret
