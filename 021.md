# Cryptography - Public Key

## Introduction

Public key crypto allows you encrypt with one key and have someone else decrypt the message with a different key.

This has two uses:
- confidentiality: send a secret messages to someone
- integrity: ensure something wasn't modified and prove who created it

## Explanation

A cryptographic technique where both parties in the communication use different keys.

Bob has a private key and a public key.  
The public key is known by everyone.  
Alice can use Bob's public key to encrypt a message and send it to Bob.  
Nobody can decrypt it except Bob.  
Bob decrypt Alice's message with the private key.

## Public and Private Keys?

Mathematically related keys that allow you to encrypt with one and decrypt with the other.

Similar to the mathematics used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Every user has two keys: a public and a private key.
- __public keyspace: not a secret, anyone can have it
- __private key__: secret, only the owner can have it

## Asymmetric Encryption

### Encryption with the public key

- C = Epub-alice(M)
- M = Dpriv-alice(C)

### Encryption with the private key

- C = Epriv-alice(M)
- M = Dpub-alice(C)

Other encryption/decryption pairs don't works!

## Problem #1

Public key Cryptography is very slow.

Decryption speeds
- AES-128: 100MB/s
- RSA-1024: 1MB/s

Using this for big files would be horrible...

## Solution #1

We combine symmetric and asymmetric tools.

If Alice wants to send Bob a message, she...
- chooses a random symmetric key, k
- computes CT=Ek(M) and sends it to Bob
- computes CT2=Epub-bob(k) and sends it to Bob

Bob uses his private key to decrypt CT2 into k and then uses k to decrypt CT and get the message.

Most cryptography on the internet is based, in part, on this concept.

## Problem #2

Mallory is a malicious attacker who can intercept and modify messages.

Alice computes CT=Epub-bob(M) and sends it to Bob.  
Mallory intercepts it and throws it away.  
Mallory computes CTevil=Epub-bob(Mevil) and sends it to Bob.  
Bob decrypts it, can't tell that it isn't from Alice...

## Problem Explained

Our current technique provides confidentiality but not integrity.

Mallory couldn't read the message from Alice.  
Mallow replaced the message and Bob didn't know.

Solution?

## Public Key Crypto for Integrity

If Alice wants to send a message, M, to Bob that proves it is from her.

She computes DS=Epriv-alice(M) and sends it to Bob.  
Bob decrypts it by calculating M=Dpub-alice(DS).  
Who can perform the encryption? Only Alice, with her private key.  
Who can perform the decryption? Anyone, because Alice's public key is public...  
Bob knows the message is from Alice because only ALice could have produced it.  

Notice, this doesn't guarantee confidentiality.

We call this a __digital signature__.

## Speed Problem for Integrity

What if you want to sign a large file? This would be too slow.

Instead, sign a hash of the file.

## RSA

The first public key cryptosystem.

Invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman.

Any bit size is ok
- 512 was standard when it was released
- 2048 or 4096 is standard now

Based on prime numbers and factoring
- the public key is the product of two primes
- the private key is those two primes

How secure is this?
- if factoring large numbers is easy, RSA is easy to break
- if factoring large numbers is hard, RSA is hard to break
- right now we think factoring large numbers is hard but we can't prove it

A bruteforce attack is basically trying to factor the public key into two prime numbers.

## Note on Bit Size

In symmetric key crypto, the key size is given in bits:
- AES-128 means AES with a 128-bit key
- 128-bits measures the keyspace (number of possible keys)

In RSA asymmetric key crypto, the prime number size is given in bits:
- RSA-2048 means RSA is using 2048-bit prime numbers to create the public and private keys

Comparisons between symmetric and asymmetric security cannot be done based just on bit size.
