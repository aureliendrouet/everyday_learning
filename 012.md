Bit Hacks
===

Bit hacks are ingenious little programming tricks that manipulate integers in a smart and efficient manner. Instead of performing some operation (such as counting the 1 bits in an integer) by looping over individual bits, these programming nuggets do the same with one or two carefully chosen bitwise operations.

```c
// Check if the integer is even or odd
if ((x & 1) == 0) {
  // x is even
}
else {
  // x is odd
}

// Test if the n-th bit is set
if (x & (1 << n)) {
  // n-th bit is set
} else {
  // n-th bit is not set
}

// Set the n-th bit
y = x | (1 << n)

// Unset the n-th bit
y = x & ~(1 << n)

// Toggle the n-th bit
y = x ^ (1 << n)

// Turn off the rightmost 1-bit
y = x & (x - 1)

// Isolate the rightmost 1-bit
y = x & (-x)

// Right propagate the rightmost 1-bit
y = x | (x - 1)

// Isolate the rightmost 0-bit
y = ~x & (x + 1)

// Turn on the rightmost 0-bit
y = x | (x + 1)
```
