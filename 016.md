# Cryptography - Modern

Modern cryptography is based heavily on mathematics

Three types of cryptography
- Secret Key Cryptography (Symmetric)
- Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric)
- Message Digest (Hashing)

## Secret Key Cryptography

A cryptographic technique where both parties in the communication share the same key

## Public Key Cryptography

A cryptographic technique where both parties in the communication use different keys

## Message Digest

Transform any arbitrary message into a fixed length number

Should be one-way!

Widely used in a lot of computing.

## Types of Cryptanalysis

__Ciphertext Only__: Attacker only has ciphertext, needs to decrypt it

__Known Plaintext__: Attacker knows some ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext, needs to decrypt some other ciphertext

__Chosen Plaintext__: Attacker can get any plaintext he wants encrypted, needs to decrypt some specific ciphertext
