# Cryptography - Operating Modes

Block ciphers encrypt fixed size data blocks using fixed size keys.

What if I want to encrypt more than just a block?

We need to break up the data into blocks and then encrypt those.

The way we do this impacts security...

There are 5 traditional ways, called operating modes!
- Electronic Codebook (ECB)
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- Cipher Feedback (CFB)
- Output Feedback (OFB)
- Counter (CTR)

## Electronic Code Book (ECB)

### Obvious method
- Break data into blocks
- Encrypt each block independently
- Use the same key for every block

### Problems

The same PT blocks produce the same CT blocks
- Just like a substitution cipher in the simple ciphers. This is vulnerable to frequency analysis.
- Many computer files have duplicate blocks and we don't want an attacker to be able to tell this

## Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)

Each block is dependent on the previous one.

The PT of the block N+1 is XOR with the CT of the block N before the encryption.

The first block needs an IV (Initialization Vector) to XOR with the PT.

### Problems

If I want to change the PT of one block, I muse re-encrypt every following block.

For some cases, this is based
- encrypted file systems...

## Counter (CTR)

Simulates a stream cipher.

Each block is encrypted independently, but it involves an incrementing nonce.

A nonce is a number chosen randomly but is not a secret.
- identical to an IV, but a different name just because of how it is used
